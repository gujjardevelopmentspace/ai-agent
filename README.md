Request for Proposal – AI Tutor Platform with Interactive Avatar  Objective The client intends to develop an AI tutoring platform for students, with the goal of making learning more engaging and effective. Unlike the initial versions based only on a voice assistant, the new request is to create an AI Tutor with an interactive avatar, capable of: • Teaching lessons with a realistic and natural avatar. • Interacting with the student during the lesson: asking questions, checking attention and comprehension. • Answering student questions in real time, adapting to the school level and context. • Using a Socratic approach (“hint-first”) to stimulate reflection and reasoning.  Project Phases  Initial Demo (Proof of Concept) Creation of a demo video showing how the AI avatar can conduct a mini-lesson, interact with the student, and answer a question. Objective: validate the provider’s technical capabilities and the quality of the avatar.  MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Web platform with: • Interactive AI avatar (voice + synchronized animation). • Real-time interaction (questions to the student + answers). • Basic features: quizzes, progress tracking, dashboard for student and parent. Indicative timeline: 4 months.  Full Platform Development After MVP validation, the client plans a dedicated budget for extending the project with all planned features (adaptive learning, advanced gamification, multimodal content, etc.).  Request for Quotation The client requests from the provider: • A detailed quotation for the development of the demo and the MVP with an interactive avatar. • An estimated delivery timeline. • Any technological proposals (AI stack, voice, avatar, cloud).  Additional Requirement To ensure the right developer or software company is selected, providers must demonstrate their capability by either presenting previous projects with similar requirements or by creating at least a demo video showcasing the requested features.
